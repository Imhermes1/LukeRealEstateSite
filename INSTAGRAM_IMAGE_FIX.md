# Instagram Image Loading Fix

## Problem
Instagram images were failing to load with 403 Forbidden errors. This is a common issue with Instagram's Graph API where image URLs are temporary and have access restrictions.

## Root Cause
Instagram's Graph API returns image URLs that:
- Are temporary and expire quickly
- Have referrer restrictions
- Are not meant to be accessed directly from browsers
- Return 403 Forbidden when accessed without proper headers

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Image Proxy (Primary Solution)
- **File**: `app/api/instagram/proxy/route.ts`
- **How it works**: Proxies Instagram images through your server
- **Benefits**: 
  - Bypasses 403 errors
  - Adds proper headers (User-Agent, Referer)
  - Implements caching (1 hour)
  - Handles CORS issues

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **File**: `app/components/Social.tsx`
- **Feature**: Fallback to placeholder images when Instagram images fail
- **Benefits**: Graceful degradation, never shows broken images

### 3. Alternative API Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/instagram/basic/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Uses Instagram Basic Display API as fallback
- **Benefits**: Different API with potentially more reliable image URLs

## How to Test

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for these messages:
   - `✅ Instagram posts loaded from API (with proxy): X`
   - `✅ Instagram posts loaded from Basic Display API: X`
   - `⚠️ Using fallback Instagram posts`

2. **Network Tab**: Check that images are loading from `/api/instagram/proxy?url=...`

3. **Image Loading**: Images should load without 403 errors

## Environment Variables Required

For the proxy solution to work, ensure these are set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_GRAPH_TOKEN=your_access_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_USER_ID=your_user_id
```

For the basic display API fallback:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_BASIC_TOKEN=your_basic_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_USER_ID=your_user_id
```

## Troubleshooting

### If images still don't load:
1. Check that environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify Instagram API credentials are valid
3. Check server logs for proxy errors
4. Ensure Instagram account is Business/Creator type

### If you see fallback images:
1. Instagram API might be down
2. Credentials might be expired
3. Rate limits might be exceeded

## Performance Notes

- Images are cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls
- Proxy adds minimal latency
- Fallback system ensures site always works

## Alternative Solutions

If the proxy approach doesn't work, consider:
1. Using a third-party Instagram widget service
2. Manually updating the fallback images in `app/lib/api.ts`
3. Using Instagram's oEmbed API for individual posts
